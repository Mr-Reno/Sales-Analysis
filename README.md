# Sales-Analysis
This project involves analyzing sales data for a fictional retail company called "Gaisano Capital" to identify trends, patterns, and insights that can help the company make better business decisions. The data contains information about customer demographics, products, and transactions.
Project Goals:

Understand the sales data and extract insights that can help the company make better business decisions.
Create a SQL database to store the data.
Write SQL queries to analyze the data and generate reports that answer key business questions.
Dataset:
The dataset consists of three tables:

customers - contains information about the customers, such as customer ID, name, age, gender, and city.
products - contains information about the products sold by the company, such as product ID, name, price, and category.
transactions - contains information about the transactions, such as transaction ID, customer ID, product ID, quantity, and date.
SQL Queries:
The SQL queries that will be used to analyze the data and generate reports include:

Find the total revenue generated by each product category.
Find the top 10 customers who have spent the most money at the store.
Find the number of transactions and revenue generated each month.
Find the average age of customers who buy products in each product category.
Find the number of customers in each city who have made at least one transaction.
Project Structure:
The project structure will consist of the following files:

README.md - a file that describes the project, its goals, and the dataset used.
sales_analysis.sql - a file that contains the SQL code used to create the database and perform the analysis.
data/ - a directory that contains the dataset in CSV format.
reports/ - a directory that contains the reports generated by the SQL queries.
